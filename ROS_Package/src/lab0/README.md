# Lab 0 
In this lab, we will write a basic ROS package that controls the robot with a keyboard. In addition, we will also implement another ROS node that subscribes to the robot Pose from SLAM, and plots the robot trajectory.  

Please refer to the [lab0.pdf](lab0.pdf) for details. 

## Get Started
### How to build
Even if you have not filled in any code for this lab, you can still build the packages and check what functionalities we have provided for you.

- Open a command line window under to the ```ROS_ws``` and type.

    ```bash
    catkin_make 
    ```
- After the system build successfully, you will need to read and execute setups for your build by 
    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
# How to run your package
## Run the keyboard control
## Run the trajectory plotting
