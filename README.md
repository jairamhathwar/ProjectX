## TODO List
1. System Identification and Verification
- Find the mapping from *(current state, controller input)* to the *controls* in the kinedynamic bicycle model using Vicon data
- Verify the ZED2 SLAM state estimation accuracy based on Vicon data
- Find the mapping from *(current state, controller input)* to the *controls* in the kinedynamic bicycle model using ZED2 SLAM data
- (Optional) Use learning based methods to model vehicle dynamics
2. Low-level Control - Trajectory Tracking
